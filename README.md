## Design Decisions

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with the idea of of a warm athmosphere in mind. Images of Pizza create the illusion of warmth as a Pizza dome would provide. The hope is to provide a website which is aesthetically pleasing and provides information in a simple and navigatable manner.

### Color

For color I have kept it simple with the major colors being a dark shade of green (#013220) with aspects of white and black as the majority of the font colors. Hints of grey (#343a40) can also be spotted as the call to action colors so that they differ with the rest of the flow of the page.

More specifically green (#013220) was chosen to mimic the herbs and spices associated within Italian Cuisine.

### Fonts 

Lato with from Google Fonts was used for the majority of this project with a fall back of sans serif. Lato was specifically designed to provide clean information in a concise manner.


### Structure of Pages

The page created is structured in a way which is easy recognizable to other web pages in the way it has a navigation bar on the top of the page and a footer at the bottom of each page. 
The navaigation bar is duplicated in each page so that it is easy to navigate to other pages from the main home page. On this, the website consists of 4 separate pages:

Home: 
    This is the main page of the website, it consists of a carousel with 3 images that prompts the customer to book a table with the restaurant. The button redirects to the contact us page.
Menu:
    This page provides the menu for Dunne and Crescenzi, it provides tabs at the top of the page which allows the user to switch between which location they would prefer to dine in.
Gallery:
    This page consists of several images in a grid pattern which showcases the capabilities of Dunne and Crescenzi in terms of event holding/catering.
Contact Us:
    The contact us page is divided into 3 sections. "Frequently asked questions", "Book a table" as well as "Our Locations". 
    
        Frequently asked questions consists of 3 vertivally aligned cards which once clicked expands to answer the question on the card.

        Book a table consists of a form again veritically aligned on which the user can fill our to ask a query.

        The section "Our Locations" follows the flow of the menu page in which that we provide two different clickable tabs in which the user would like to dine in. Once clicked the location, email address and phone number of each location is provided.
