## Design Decisions

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with the idea of of a warm athmosphere in mind. Images of Pizza create the illusion of warmth as a Pizza dome would provide. The hope is to provide a website which is aesthetically pleasing and provides information in a simple and navigatable manner.

### Color

For color I have kept it simple with the major colors being a dark shade of green (#013220) with aspects of white and black as the majority of the font colors. Hints of grey (#343a40) can also be spotted as the call to action colors so that they differ with the rest of the flow of the page.

More specifically green (#013220) was chosen to mimic the herbs and spices associated within Italian Cuisine.

![Colour Scheme](docs/adobe-color-palette.png)

### Fonts 

Lato with from Google Fonts was used for the majority of this project with a fall back of sans serif. Lato was specifically designed to provide clean information in a concise manner.


## Structure of Pages

The page created is structured in a way which is easy recognizable to other web pages in the way it has a navigation bar on the top of the page and a footer at the bottom of each page. 
The navaigation bar is duplicated in each page so that it is easy to navigate to other pages from the main home page. On this, the website consists of 4 separate pages:

- Home: This is the main page of the website, it consists of a carousel with 3 images that prompts the customer to book a table with the restaurant. The button redirects to the contact us page.

- Menu: This page provides the menu for Dunne and Crescenzi, it provides tabs at the top of the page which allows the user to switch between which location they would prefer to dine in.

- Gallery: This page consists of several images in a grid pattern which showcases the capabilities of Dunne and Crescenzi in terms of event holding/catering.

- Contact Us:
    - The contact us page is divided into 3 sections. "Frequently asked questions", "Book a table" as well as "Our Locations". 

    - Frequently asked questions consists of 3 vertivally aligned cards which once clicked expands to answer the question on the card.

    - Book a table consists of a form again veritically aligned on which the user can fill our to ask a query.

The section "Our Locations" follows the flow of the menu page in which that we provide two different clickable tabs in which the user would like to dine in. Once clicked the location, email address and phone number of each location is provided.

## Features

This website consists of 4 pages.

### Logo and Navigation Bar

- The navbar is completely responsive and turns into a toggler (hamburger menu) once the screen becomes too small
    - The navbar can be found on all 4 pages of the site.
    - It allows the customer to easily navigate the site.
    - Once the user hovers over a link it an animated underline activates under the link.

![Logo and Navbar](docs/features-nav-bar-and-logo.png)

### Carousel

- The carousel consists of 3 images which actively change, they can also be manually changed using the two next and previous controls on either side of the image or by clicking on the horizontal lines on the bottom of the images.
- In the middle of the image is a Call To Action named "Book a Table" which once clicked navigates to the contact us page where the user is able to book a table using the form.

![Carousel Showcase Prev and Next Buttons](docs/features-carousel-prev-next-buttons.png)

### Menu and Menu Tabs

- Included in the Menu page is a tab on the top of the page which the user is able to click. It allows the user to be able to click on the menu on which location they would prefer to dine in.
- The menu is in a pattern in which it is easy to read, it provides the starters at the beginning and an image on the right which showcases a sample item on the menu.

![Menu Tabs](docs/features-menu-tabs.png)

### Gallery 

- There is a separate page in the website named Gallery, this provides users who visit a sample of what Dunne and Crescenzi is able to do in terms of weddings/events/catering.

![Gallery Page](docs/features-gallery.png)

### Contact Us

- The Contact Us page is separated into 3 separate sections as mentioned earlier
    - Frequently Asked Questions
        - This provides users who visit common questions that have previously been asked. It eliminates the user having to contact and therefore making it a much easier contact.
        ![FAQ Accordion Active Question](docs/features-faq-accordion.png)
    - Book a Table
        - If the customer prefers to book a table through a form rather than contacting through form, they can (theoretically) do this through the book a table form.
        ![Book a Table Form](docs/features-contact-form.png)
    - Our Locations
        - Like the menu, "Our Locations" contains a tab which the user is able to click based on which location we offer is more convenient for them. Once clicked the information provided (Address, Email, Phone Number and Map Details) are updated.
        ![Locations Tab Information](docs/features-location-tabs.png)

### Footer

- The footer consists of 3 equally alligned columns which provide 3 separate information. Address which provies the address, Follow Us provides the social media clickable icons and Contact Us which provides the phone number for the restaurant.
![Footer](docs/features-footer-social-media-handles.png)

### 404 Error Page

- The 404.html page consists of the navigation bar as well as the footer that the other pages include. The addition in this page is an image in the middle of the screen as well as a CTA underneath which links back to the main index.html page. By doing this we are eliminating the task for the user to have to click the back button when they have entered a page in which does not exist.

## Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM Accessibility Tool was used to validate and evaluate the accessibility of each page of the site. Please find the screenshots of these below.

## Performance

Tool used was Google Lighthouse which is accessible through the inspect tool, and second to last in its navbar. Like Accessibility, screenshots for performance on each page are below.

<summary>Gallery</summary>
<img src="docs/lighthouse-performance-gallery.png">
While Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO are all 100, Performance is 59 which is to be expected due to the amount of images within the gallery. Optimization attempts were to compress each image as well as convert from PNG to WebP which was recommended directly from Google as it was developed by them.

## Bugs and their Fixes

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
|-------------|------------|
|Div Alt Content for Carousel as this will appear as an error during validation| Reformat Carousel so that it uses img rather than style: background|
|Responsiveness of Carousel Images| Implement multiple media queries which change the image height based on screen size|
|Rather lacking contrast between the carousel text and the image itself| Implemented a background on the carousel text and set its background to rgb with a 4th input which is the alpha, this mimics opacity without touching the text |
|Tab once toggled matches white background| Change background to dark shade mentioned in Color Descisions above|
